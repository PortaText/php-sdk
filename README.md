# php-sdk
PHP Client for the PortaText API.

# Documentation
The autogenerated documentation can be found in the [doc](https://github.com/PortaText/php-sdk/blob/master/doc/ApiIndex.md) directory.

The [endpoint tests](https://github.com/PortaText/php-sdk/tree/master/test/endpoints) should also serve as good doucmentation on how to use the API.

# Installing
Add this library to your [Composer](https://packagist.org/) configuration. In
composer.json:
```json
  "require": {
    "portatext": "1.*"
  }
```

# Basic use

## Getting a client instance
The first thing is to get a [Client](https://github.com/PortaText/php-sdk/blob/master/src/PortaText/Client/Base.php) instance, for example
the [Curl](https://github.com/PortaText/php-sdk/blob/master/src/PortaText/Client/Curl.php) implementation:

```php
use PortaText\Client\Curl as Client;
$portatext = new Client();
```

## (Optional) Set your logger
You can optionally set a [PSR-3](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/) compatible logger:
```php
$portatext->setLogger($logger);
```

By default, the client will use the [NullLogger](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-3/#1-4-helper-classes-and-interfaces).

## Authenticating
You can authenticate to the endpoints by using your API key or your username/password. This translates to
either doing this:

```php
$client->setApiKey($apiKey);
```

Or this:

```php
$client->setCredentials($username, $password);
```

# Using the endpoints
All the API commands can be found in the [Command/Api](https://github.com/PortaText/php-sdk/tree/master/src/PortaText/Command/Api)
directory. The client offers a way to instantiate them by just calling them by their name.

## Quick example
As an example, to create a template, you would do:

```php
$client
  ->templates()                       // Get an instance of the Templates endpoint.
  ->text("The text of my template")
  ->description("My first template")
  ->name("template1")
  ->post();                           // Call the Templates endpoint with a POST.
```

To get a template by id:

```php
$client->templates()->withId(45)->get();
```

Or, to get all the templates:

```php
$client->templates()->get();
```

# Developers

 * test: Runs [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/).
 * cs: Runs [CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).
 * doc: Runs [PhpDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org/).
 * md: runs [PHPMD](http://phpmd.org/).
 * build: This is the default task, and will run all the other tasks.

## Running a phing task
To run a task, just do:

```sh
vendor/bin/phing build
```

## Contributing
To contribute:
 * Make sure you open a **concise** and **short** pull request.
 * Throw in any needed unit tests to accomodate the new code or the
 changes involved.
 * Run `phing` and make sure everything is ok before submitting the pull
 request (make phpmd and CodeSniffer happy, also make sure that phpDocumentor
 does not throw any warnings, since all our documentation is automatically
 generated).
 * Your code must comply with [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/),
 CodeSniffer should take care of that.
